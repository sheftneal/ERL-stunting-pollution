# Identifying child growth eﬀects of elevated pollution levels during pregnancy

(** IN PROGRESS **)

Code and public data for Heft-Neal et al paper [`Identifying child growth eﬀects of elevated pollution levels during pregnancy'](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad993b).

The materials in this repository includes public data and the scripts used to produce the figures and calculations appearing in the main text and extended data of the paper.

If you find meaningful errors in the code or have questions or suggestions, please contact Sam Heft-Neal at sheftneal@stanford.edu.

## Organization of repository

* **scripts**: scripts for producing figures and calculations.
* **figures/raw**: pdf figures output by R scripts.
* **figures/published**: published versions of the figures. Cosmetic editing done in Adobe Illustrator to go from raw -> final versions.
* **data/inputs**: public data inputs for analysis.

* **ERL-stunting-pollution-replication.Rproj**: organizes the replication materials into an RStudio Project.





***A couple of notes on replication:***


* **A note about replication with DHS data**: Due to the data use agreement, we do not post the raw DHS data. In light of these restrictions, we have tried to include sufficiently detailed information so that any researcher with access to DHS datasets could reconstruct our analysis data exactly. For example, see Table S1 for the list of surveys included. Along with the details discussed in the methods section this should be sufficient to reconstruct the sample if you have access to the raw DHS data ([register for access to DHS data here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm)). 

If any steps are unclear please contact Sam at sheftneal@stanford.edu.
